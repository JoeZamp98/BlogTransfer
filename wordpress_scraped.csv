Winter Storm Expected Thursday (12/17),https://josephzampitella.com/2020/12/16/winter-storm-expected-thursday-12-17/,"As is likely apparent from the discussion above, I am anticipating an all-snow event for most of the region.  The one exception to this may be along the immediate south coast/Cape/Islands where southerly flow may drag in enough warm air for a flip to sleet/rain for at least part of the storm.  "

The 48 Laws of Power,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/12/06/the-48-laws-of-power/,"If you are interested in deepening your perceptivity, sharpening your ability to discern the force of power acting on everyday life, or simply want to understand with greater clarity the behaviors that propel particular individuals to prestige, let Greene’s inaugural work be your guide.  "
More Beneficial Rain on the Way,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/10/16/more-beneficial-rain-on-the-way/,"As the surface low pulls away toward the Canadian Maritimes between 12Z and 15Z Saturday, rain will come to and end across the region, and even the cloud deck should clear by afternoon.  Brisk northwesterly winds will usher in much cooler temperatures for Saturday afternoon.  "
Strong Wind & A Few Storms Wednesday,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/10/07/strong-wind-a-few-storms-wednesday/,"During the overnight hours, the 50kt+ core of the low level jet will translate north, eventually pulling away from eastern Maine by 15Z Thursday.  Granted, the low-level thermal profile will become less conducive to momentum transport as the night wears on, so I am expecting the most widespread strong wind gusts to occur during the evening/early overnight across southern and central New England.  Even behind this most intense core of the wind, Thursday should still be a blustery day region-wide as pronounced cold air advection continues.  "
Isaias Arrives in New England Tuesday,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/08/03/isaias-arrives-in-new-england-tuesday/,"Those in the region where tornado potential is greatest (from DelMarVa/New Jersey in the morning, into the NYC Metro midday, and southern/central New England during the afternoon and evening) should pay close attention to the weather tomorrow.  Given the magnitude of low-level shear, several tornadoes appear possible across this region.  "
Overnight Storms in Oklahoma,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/07/30/overnight-storms-in-oklahoma/,"Based on CAM guidance, thunderstorms may begin developing as early as 21Z along the boundary.  A cluster of a few sub-severe storms was ongoing as of 20:26Z across Beckham and Washita counties, behind the wind-shift.  Even in this post-frontal environment, MLCAPE of 1500-2000j/kg could support storm maintenance and intensification, particularly given the proximity to the best upper-level support.  These storms may progress eastward towards southern sections of the OKC Metro area over the next few hours.  "
Unsettled Weather Wednesday and Thursday,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/07/22/unsettled-weather-wednesday-and-thursday/,"Though the overall evolution of the convection on Thursday is somewhat less clear, model soundings characterized by the aforementioned characteristics, straight hodographs, and 6-7C/KM H7-H5 lapse rates would imply that a corridor of elevated severe weather potential, with relatively intense storms capable of all hazards, may evolve during the late afternoon and evening somewhere in central/southern New England.  Stay tuned for details.  "
Isolated Severe Storms Possible This Afternoon,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/07/05/isolated-severe-storms-possible-this-afternoon/,"With dry mid-levels and glancing forcing, storm coverage is expected to be quite low. In fact, some CAMs don’t develop storms at all outside of northern Maine.  I do expect at least one or two storms to form further south, and given the environment described previously, any cell that manages to sustain itself could become severe.  The most likely hazards appear to be large hail (perhaps 1-1.5″ in diameter), strong winds, and the outside chance of a brief tornado.  "
"A Few Storms North Today, Cooler for the Fourth",https://josephzampitella.com/2020/07/02/a-few-storms-north-today-cooler-for-the-fourth/,"Northerly-to-northeasterly flow will likely maintain itself at the surface through the Independence Day holiday.  With the strong July sun angle, the temperatures in the cool sector should moderate at least somewhat on Saturday, but with the breeze off the North Atlantic, daytime highs will probably struggle to exceed 72-74F at the immediate coast, and 80F inland, well below average for midsummer.  "
Strong Storms Probable Today (6-28),https://josephzampitella.com/2020/06/28/strong-storms-probable-today-6-28/,"The most probably scenario appears to be the evolution of one or more bands of storms, with strong to severe cells embedded across central and particularly Southern New England, perhaps extending westward into portions of the lower Hudson Valley.   The chance of storms should maximize between 18-22Z, perhaps lingering a bit longer in the easternmost counties.  "
Toasts for Two,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/06/27/toasts-for-two/,"Plate your avocado toast together with your cherry tomato toast.  I think they look best on a plain white serving dish, but feel free to personalize the presentation as you see fit.  Add a garnish of fresh thyme and/or basil, and you’re ready to serve!"
Chance of Thunderstorms Later Today,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/06/24/chance-of-thunderstorms-later-today/,"Based on the factors outlined above, the mean of solutions expressed by the convection allowing models appears reasonable.  Thunderstorms will develop ahead of the advancing cold front by 2PM and push east.  It seems probable that the highest concentration of storms will be across southern portions of New Hampshire, far southwest Maine and northeastern Massachusetts.  In this region, a strong to severe storm or two is not out of the question.  "
Heat Builds in New England Late This Week,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/06/16/heat-builds-in-new-england-late-this-week/,"In conjunction with the warm air advection aloft, the boundary layer will also gradually moisten across the Northeast through the weekend as surface flow develops a more southerly component.  The peak of the hot and humid conditions at this time appears to be on Saturday,  though humid (but perhaps somewhat less hot) weather could linger into early next week.  "
A Superior Breakfast,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/06/04/my-test-recipe/,"Once well-blended, pour the fruit puree into a serving bowl.  Next, add the toppings to taste.  My favorite combination of toppings includes generous helpings of granola, chia seeds, taco nibs, and fresh berries, with a light dusting of cinnamon on top.  For an extra pop of color and citrus, add a lemon twist just before serving.  "
New England Storm Chances (6/6/2020) – Analysis,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/06/04/example-post-3/,"All factors together, the forecast above tightly reflected the ultimate convective evolution.  Storms developed as expected along the surging cold front and intensified as they approached the coast.  Most damaging wind reports were concentrated within the area delineated as higher-risk across central and eastern Massachusetts, northeast Connecticut, southeast New Hampshire, and southern Maine.
