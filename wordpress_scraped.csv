Winter Storm Expected Thursday (12/17),https://josephzampitella.com/2020/12/16/winter-storm-expected-thursday-12-17/,"Summary: An early-season winter storm will impact much of southern New England Wednesday night and Thursday.  Snow will overspread the region from southwest to northeast Wednesday evening, likely reaching Boston around 10PM and becoming heavy quickly thereafter.  The peak of the storm should last from approximately 12AM – 10AM Thursday, gradually winding down through the midday and afternoon hours.      Unlike our last system, where quite a bit of rain got involved and lowered snow totals along the coast, this storm should be all snow for the majority of the region.  A bit of sleet or rain may be introduced at the immediate south coast, so I have lowered snowfall totals in that region a bit.  Snow should be light and fluffy northwest of the I-95 corridor, and thus will accumulate quite quickly.  A broad region of 8-12″ amounts is expected, with localized jackpots in the 14-16″ range.  At this point, the most favored region for the jackpot amounts appears to be along I-90, perhaps in the metrowest suburbs.    There will be a period of wind with this storm as well – gusts to 35-45mph may occur along east and south-facing shorelines at the height of the storm.  A period of near-blizzard conditions is possible, particularly across Cape Ann and southeastern Massachusetts.    Discussion: A bit of an unusual setup for a significant winter storm in the northeast featuring some classic elements and others that would point towards a less potent event.  All things considered, I think many will see some of the largest December snowstorms in recent years.    Let’s start with the basics – cold air and moisture.  The antecedent airmass in place across the northeast is quite cold – as of 00Z Wednesday, temperatures were below 0F across southern Quebec and ranged from the single digits above 0F to the mid-20s across New England.  This is quite cold for December and certainly supportive of significant snowfall.  A very strong 1035mb high pressure centered over central Quebec and is actually forecast to strengthen into the day tomorrow, locking in the cold airmass in the low levels.      Moist air near and just east of the Carolinas is also present as of 00Z Wednesday.  Surface pressure falls should begin in this region overnight tonight, advancing northward during the day on Wednesday, and the moist air will be drawn north accordingly.  This process, combined with the previously discussed cold airmass in place in New England, is a classic recipe for significant snowfall.    On to the not-so-classic elements of this situation.  The 500mb trough currently over Oklahoma (as a closed low) is going to de-amplify as it advances northeastward through the prevailing flow.  As it approaches the east coast, the disturbance will still be strong enough to induce surface cyclonegenesis.  Though the latitudinally elongated low pressure center is not expected to be particularly deep, 995mb at the deepest, the high ambient pressure of the environment should allow for some decent low-level wind fields to develop.    In terms of precipitation, a shield of snow will advance northward from the Tri-State area into New England by Wednesday evening.  Timing should be about 7pm in southwest CT, 8pm in northeast CT/western MA, 9pm in RI/central Ma, and 10pm in eastern MA/southern NH.  Once the snow begins, it will quickly become very heavy due to intense mid-level forcing.    Impressive speed convergence will lead to intense frontogenesis near 700mb in a broad west-east band that will advance northward in tandem with the nose of the 700mb jet.  If this band slows or stalls in at any point – rapid snowfall accumulation is possible, as rates under this band will likely be 1-2″+ per hour.    At the surface, a coastal front will develop as the low deepens and organizes the low-level wind field.  It appears at this point that the front should spend much of the storm near or just west of I-95, before collapsing to the coast as the low advances east of 40N/70W.  On the cold side of this boundary, temperatures will be very cold and support high snow-to-liquid ratios.  The warmer side of this boundary will feature temperatures in the high 20s to low 30s, certainly cold enough for snow but the ratios may be held down a bit in this region.    As is likely apparent from the discussion above, I am anticipating an all-snow event for most of the region.  The one exception to this may be along the immediate south coast/Cape/Islands where southerly flow may drag in enough warm air for a flip to sleet/rain for at least part of the storm.  "
The Signal & The Noise,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/12/10/the-signal-the-noise/,"Nate Silver  How significant of an outlier was 9/11?  To a certain extent, the answer to this question depends on how the data is charted.  Using a graph with linear axes, the death toll from the September 11th terrorist attacks presents as a dramatic deviation from the norm, with the vast majority of terrorist attacks resulting in less than 200 fatalities.  However, if plotted instead on a double-log chart (both x and y-axes are logarithmic), the relationship between the number of fatalities in an attack and the frequency with which such-sized attacks occur appears perfectly inverse.  Stated more concisely, deadlier terrorist attacks occur less frequently and the relationship between increased fatalities and frequency is double-log linear. In this interpretation, the September 11th attacks, despite their morbidly high death toll, not only lack outlier status, but should have been expected to happen given a long enough span of time.    Nate Silver spends much of The Signal and the Noise exploring where predictions have historically gone wrong – television political punditry, the stock market, and earthquakes, to name a few prime examples.  He balances these critiques against instances where the human capacity for prediction has markedly improved, most notably with weather forecasting.  I originally picked up The Signal curious to learn more about the mind behind FiveThirtyEight’s presidential forecast in the run-up to the 2020 election.  Silver founded FiveThirtyEight in 2008 and the blog is now owned by The Walt Disney Company.    In the aftermath of the 2020 election, the veracity of The Signal’s thesis about political prognostication proved itself out yet again.  Silver explores how seldom political prognosticators have predicted electoral outcomes correctly in the past, likely due to the overwhelming influence of bias in subjective projections – a pattern that certainly held true in 2020. I am hard pressed to find a member of the intelligentsia who predicted that Donald Trump would post some of his most significant electoral improvements in the Rio Grande Valley, Miami-Dade County and the Bronx.  As Silver outlines in his cleverly titled chapter “Are You Smarter than a Television Pundit?”, political prognostication is just one example of a field where deterministic, inherently overconfident forecasts are valued, but do a disservice to the consumer. Audiences perceive outlooks expressed precisely as reliable, but precision does not necessarily correlate with accuracy. The Signal makes the case that electoral outcomes, and other instance where results rely on a delicate and complex web of variables, are best expressed probabilistically.  With low-propensity events occurring every day, probabilistic forecasts better capture the true range of possibilities than proclamations, even if the latter may leave the audience with a stronger impression of reliability.   Silver prominently features Bayes’ Theorem, a central method for forecasting amidst uncertain circumstances.  Born in 1702, Thomas Bayes believed in the notion of divine perfection and supported the Newtonian position that nature follows predictable laws.  Despite his belief in divinity, Bayes viewed the human understanding of the universe in a more delicate light. He recognized that as humans gather information about the world, their ability to both understand and predict phenomena increases proportionally. Though our predictions may improve with as information is added to our assumptions, Bayes posited that we can only approach, not truly reach, a perfect understanding of the universe and its laws.   Despite its nuanced origin story, Bayes’ Theorem is quite simple mathematically.  The process of forecasting begins with assigning a prior probability, your initial estimate of how likely a particular event is to occur. New information is then integrated with this initial number to generate a posterior probability, the estimate of likelihood reached after taking new information into account.  Utilizing Bayes’ Theorem allows predictions to become less and less wrong over time, countering the influence of bias present in the initial forecast.  The Bayesian way of thinking is widely applicable and can help individuals and organizations significantly improve the way they handle decisions by framing the issue at hand in a probabilistic light more tolerant of inherent uncertainty.   Despite the available devices, Bayes’ Theorem among many others, helping humans improve decision making, examples abound of forecasts gone wrong.  The Signal features the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis as just such a critical error. Efficient Market Hypothesis, a theory tracing its origins to Eugene Fama’s 1965 Ph.D. thesis at the University of Chicago, played a key role in the development of the financial crisis. Dr. Fama utilized data collected during the 1950s to support his assertion that past investment fund performance is not indicative of future results.  Specifically, he showed that investment funds posting impressive (or poor) returns one year, were no more or less likely than any other to post strong (or weak) returns in the next year.    As Silver outlines, the theoretical underpinnings of the efficient-market hypothesis are not so distal from core Bayesian principals, and assert that stock prices should self-correct as traders and investors learn more information.  Why doesn’t this assumption hold up in the real world?  As anyone following markets can attest, prices inflate beyond reasonable levels for a host of reasons.  One convincing explanation offered by The Signal focuses on the misaligned incentives traders face – it is not necessarily advantageous for them to focus exclusively on exactly what the market will do next.  Say a trader believes prices are displaced to the high side – it is riskier to short the market in this situation than it to sell despite a belief that securities are undervalued.  In the former case, an individual shorting the market is likely amongst a small group, meaning the opportunity cost of betting against a rising market could be extreme.  Should prices rise, not only is the short individual losing money, others are making money at the same time, accentuating the performance gap.  Such a miscalculation could be career-ending for a trader.  For this reason, traders are likely to continue buying stocks even if they suspect that they are overpriced, as the real-world implications of selling or shorting the market can be too severe and cloud their logical reasoning.  The result of this is that markets do not follow Bayesian mean reversion as one would expect in a vacuum, because human incentive structures and biases are at play.  As The Signal explores, situations like the one outlined previously confront us routinely – in these instances the pure accuracy of a forecast is not the sole consideration, complicating how forecasts are formulated, communicated, and understood.    The Signal and the Noise is a fascinating exploration of how probability, bias, and the science of prediction affect our lives.  Lessons from this book can be applied to improve your life financially, sharpen your decision-making abilities, and become more comfortable with uncertainty in the world.  The book is certainly enjoyable as a cover-to-cover read, but if certain chapters strike your fancy, they stand alone quite well as concise explorations of more focused topical areas. Particularly in an era defined by uncertainty, it is wise to consider the future in probabilistic terms, weighing not only the most likely outcomes, but the full range of possibilities.    "
The 48 Laws of Power,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/12/06/the-48-laws-of-power/,"Robert Greene  “20: Do not commit to anyone”.    “27: Play on people’s need to believe to create a cult following.”  “37: Create compelling spectacles.”  Robert Greene’s The 48 Laws of Power is eerily of the current historical moment.  First published in 1998, the pages of this work read as if imbued with the headlines of the last half-decade. The parallels between the lessons of Greene’s first major literary accomplishment and the events of post-Obama America are some of the strongest support I’ve encountered for the aphorism ‘History may not repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme’.   In The 48 Laws, Greene charts a mental landscape foreign to most people – a landscape defined by foresight, calculation, cunning, and restraint.  In a culture that purports to value kindness, morality, and above all authenticity, The 48 Laws of Power rings cold, severe, and unnervingly familiar.  An unmissable work that threads together millennia of historical anecdotes with potent philosophical meditation, this book reveals the approach that many at the top employ to reach the pinnacles of society.    You may be put off by the insistently amoral angle Greene insists on maintaining across topics ranging from mentorship, to friendship, to money, to human nature itself – certainly not a baseless reaction by any means.  In the wrong hands, The 48 Laws runs the risk of assuming the role of Lord Henry’s Yellow Book in The Picture of Dorian Gray.  Consider everything Greene outlines: What implication do these realities have for the nature of leaders in power currently? How does this knowledge affect your own desire for and relationship with power? Is power the root of all good, the root of all evil, or does it exist on a more nuanced spectrum?    It is impossible to read The 48 Laws of Power in the year 2020 without recognizing the parallels to Donald Trump’s performance since his emergence on the political stage.  He “played on people’s need to believe”, “enter[ed] action with boldness”, got others to “play the cards” he dealt, and kept the entire world “in suspended terror”, by “cultivating an air of unpredictability”.  He is a flesh and blood embodiment of the strategies Greene sketches. Regardless of its morality, the strategy has undeniably been a success; few figures in American history have so ubiquitously commanded and colored an era.    Contemporary parallels aside, The 48 Laws retains its relevance beyond the borders of this political and cultural moment.  Regardless of whether an individual is actively pursuing power, there is much to be gained by understanding the forms it takes in day-to-day life, perhaps even more so if your desire is to thwart those in power or remain unperturbed by the pressure it exerts.  Greene distills the essence of each law into concise tabulations, “Keys to Mastery” as he calls them, helpful distillations for a book with such dense core passages.  Despite the care taken in developing the ideas behind and the contours of each law, the room remains for a reader to bend and transfigure the core lesson of each into a form that is most relevant to their own personal context.    If you are interested in deepening your perceptivity, sharpening your ability to discern the force of power acting on everyday life, or simply want to understand with greater clarity the behaviors that propel particular individuals to prestige, let Greene’s inaugural work be your guide.  "
More Beneficial Rain on the Way,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/10/16/more-beneficial-rain-on-the-way/,"Posted Friday, October 16, 2020  Summary: More beneficial rain is on the way to New England tonight and early tomorrow morning.  Unusually intense drought conditions have developed across the region over the last several months, with many areas experiencing Severe (D2) to Extreme (D3) drought.  Appreciable rain totals will likely be widespread across the region, but with the significant precipitation deficits already in place, drought conditions will probably only improve around the margins.    Analysis: Despite a rain event earlier in the week, a significant drought continues across much of New England. The most detrimental conditions exist across the D3/Extreme drought areas, including Rhode Island, eastern Connecticut/Hartford County, portions of southeastern Massachusetts, a stripe from the Merrimack Valley northeast to near Portland, and pockets of northern Maine.  Rivers and streams across the region are exhibiting well below normal water levels.    Significant year-to-date precipitation defecits, on the order of 8-16″ below normal have accrued across the region, and thus well above-average precipitation would be needed to completely eliminate drought conditions.    With that said, any precipitation is helpful, and it appears that we may make up an inch or two of our precipitation deficit during the Friday night-Saturday period.  At H500, a disturbance currently draped across Nebraska and Missouri will round the base of an amplifying shortwave as it transitions from neutral to negative tilt over the mid-Atlantic region.  A surface low will begin to develop as the strongest mid-level postivie vorticity advection commences east of the Carolina coast, and then should translate northeastward towards Cape Cod as the shortwave disturbance becomes increasingly negatively tilted and swings towards New England.      Moisture advection will be ongoing well before surface low development, along and ahead of a slowly advancing cold front.  As is apparent on visible sattelite, numerous showers and some areas of steady rain in the post-frontal environment across Pennsylvaina, New York, and western New England will gradually spread eastward in conjunction with the advancing surface boundary.  Strong southerly flow through the deep layer, advecting >1″ precipitable water values northward into New England, combined with the lift generated from the advancing surface boundary and strong upper-level venting, should result in the persistence and expansion of precipitation this afternoon.    The most impressive rainfall totals from this afternoon’s round of showers will likely set up across western New England as a band of rain currently extending from the Piedmont north into New Jersey advances northward along the leading edge of the H850 thermal gradient.   The most significant rain should occur late tonight into early Saturday morning as the surface low advances northward just offshore.  Ensembles indicate that locally heavy rainfall is possible during this period, with the most robust amounts focused in a band from RI/eastern MA northward into New Hampshire and western Maine.  Within this more focused and persistent zone of ascent, total rainfall amounts in excess of 1″ are likely in most locations, with a few locations perhaps exceeding 2″.  A risk of flash flooding may evolve across portions northern NH/VT and western Maine due to a more extended period of moderate to heavy precipitation (perhaps Friday afternoon through Saturday morning) and the likelihood of orographic enhancement with moist southerly flow running up against the White Mountains.  As the surface low pulls away toward the Canadian Maritimes between 12Z and 15Z Saturday, rain will come to and end across the region, and even the cloud deck should clear by afternoon.  Brisk northwesterly winds will usher in much cooler temperatures for Saturday afternoon.  "
Strong Wind & A Few Storms Wednesday,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/10/07/strong-wind-a-few-storms-wednesday/,"Summary: A period of strong winds are expected across much of New England Wednesday afternoon and overnight.  The strongest gusts, a few of which may exceed 50mph, should be focused across portions of southern Vermont, southern New Hampshire, and Massachusetts.  Elsewhere, gusts to 40mph should be fairly common.  Additionally,  broken bands of showers and thunderstorms will evolve during the afternoon, sweeping the area from northwest to southeast.  Winds in thunderstorms may exceed severe criteria locally, with a few gusts to 60mph.    Discussion: Tomorrow (10-7) is shaping up to be an active weather day for much of New England with a strong disturbance rotating out of southeastern Canada.  Rounding the southern edge of this trough will be a seasonally very strong (80-100kt) 500mb jet streak.    In conjunction with this jet streak, a surface low will deepen during the day, perhaps becoming a sub-990mb low by the time it reaches northern Maine Wednesday evening.  Robust mid-level positive vorticity advection, combined with some surface convergence along the quickly advancing cold front, will support several bands of showers and thunderstorms traversing the region from northwest to southeast during the afternoon hours.    Overall, the instability profile is fairly modest (generally under 750j/kg), a weakness largely attributable to a relatively dry atmospheric column.  With significant cold air advection underway above the surface during the afternoon, steep lapse rates by New England standards should evolve ahead of the convective bands, likely supporting some thunder and lightning.  With a strengthening low level jet just off the surface, any thunderstorms that are able to persist and become organized should be capable of producing a few damaging wind gusts.  Across Vermont and New Hampshire, I can’t rule out a bit of small hail as well, given seasonally cold 500mb temperatures (-21C to -23C).    As the thunderstorms begin to wind down Wednesday evening, the pressure gradient-driven wind threat should be picking up.  A 40-55kt 850mb jet should be peaking above portions of southern NH/VT and Massachusetts by 00-03Z Thursday with a surface low pressure system still deepening in northern Maine.  The lack of any inversion through the boundary layer (lapse rates are in fact quite steep as late as 00Z), should result in efficient transport of wind gusts to the surface.  With peak wind gusts of 40-50mph and fully foliated trees, I would not be at all surprised to see pockets of damage and isolated power outages.    During the overnight hours, the 50kt+ core of the low level jet will translate north, eventually pulling away from eastern Maine by 15Z Thursday.  Granted, the low-level thermal profile will become less conducive to momentum transport as the night wears on, so I am expecting the most widespread strong wind gusts to occur during the evening/early overnight across southern and central New England.  Even behind this most intense core of the wind, Thursday should still be a blustery day region-wide as pronounced cold air advection continues.  "
Isaias Arrives in New England Tuesday,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/08/03/isaias-arrives-in-new-england-tuesday/,"Monday, August 3, 2020 – 21Z  Overview: Tropical Storm Isaias will bring a range of weather conditions to New England beginning early Tuesday morning and lasting through the overnight hours.   Discussion: As of 03.21Z, Tropical Storm Isaias was approaching the South Carolina coast, and is expected to make landfall this evening as a strong tropical storm or weak hurricane.  Guidance is in good agreement regarding the track of Tropical Storm Isaias, brining it generally northward across eastern North Carolina, the DelMarVa, and the Hudson Valley, with tracks diverging just a bit as the storm advances into Vermont or New Hampshire.  When referencing the track in this forecast, we will be sticking with the official guidance from the National Hurricane Center (NHC), which is in alignment with the aforementioned numerical guidance.    GOES-16 “Sandwich” imagery reveals moisture streaming northward ahead of the cyclone amid southwesterly deep-layer flow.  In the 200-300mb layer, a jet streak is beginning to take shape above the eastern Great Lakes, and is expected to intensify and lift northward.  As Isaias advances northward, it will couple with the right entrance region of this strengthening jet streak, and should benefit from strong upper level diffluence.  Given the degree of upper level support, the overall intensity of the cyclone should maintain itself as it moves northward, even once the transition to a more extra-tropical structure is underway.    Along and to the west of Isaias’ track, a swath of heavy rainfall totals is expected.    Precipitable Water values near and in advance of the storm are exceeding 2″, and strong 850mb moisture transport is pulling rich tropical air northward and wrapping it around the cyclone, where on the northwest side, heavy rainfall will result.  The Weather Prediction Center (WPC) has issued a Moderate Risk for excessive rainfall across a broad region of the Carolinas and mid-Atlantic States — a Slight Risk for excessive rainfall extends into western and northern New England.  Isaias will be accelerating northward tonight and into the day tomorrow, which should preclude extreme rainfall totals, but widespread 2-3″ amounts look like a good bet, with isolated 6″ amounts not out of the question.    With regard to wind, Isaias should be entering into, or going through, its extratropical transition by the time it reaches Long Island/Connecticut, and thus, the low level wind field will be expanding.  Numerical guidance has been pretty bullish on the potential for damaging winds in Southern New England — given the full foliage, I am pretty concerned about the potential for downed trees and power outages tomorrow evening.  A broad 50-70kt H85 jet swings across Southern New England, generally between 20Z and 04Z.  A warm, very moist and well-mixed boundary layer is expected to be in place, and accordingly, some pretty strong gusts could be realized at the surface.  Closer to the south coast, especially in Connecticut and Rhode Island, gusts of 65-75mph could be somewhat common, with maximum gusts tapering to 40-55mph well to the northeast (say, southern New Hampshire and far NE Massachusetts).    In Isaias’ right-front quadrant, as is traditionally favored, conditions could become quite favorable for tornadoes from New Jersey, through the NYC Metro and northward into MA/CT/RI.  The low-level jet responsible for the ambient wind gusts of 50mph+ is a component of a well-organized, veering wind profile, which will result in extreme low-level shear magnitudes.  An area of 0-3KM SRH of 200-400m2/s2 or greater will advance northward in lockstep with Isaias’ center of circulation, approaching Southern New England by Tuesday afternoon.  Within this region, remarkably large, right turning hodographs are modeled, and Critical Angles in the 45-60degree range indicate the presence of significant stream-wise vorticity in the boundary layer.    With the persistent southeasterly advection of very moist boundary layer air, and perhaps even some limited solar insolation, an unstable environment will likely evolve along the leading edge of the most significant low-level shear.  It is within this corridor that the risk for tornadoes should maximize.  In southern and central New England, the tornado threat will likely be greatest between 20Z and 01Z, and generally evolve from south to north as Isaias advances.    Those in the region where tornado potential is greatest (from DelMarVa/New Jersey in the morning, into the NYC Metro midday, and southern/central New England during the afternoon and evening) should pay close attention to the weather tomorrow.  Given the magnitude of low-level shear, several tornadoes appear possible across this region.  "
Overnight Storms in Oklahoma,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/07/30/overnight-storms-in-oklahoma/,"Thursday, July 30, 2020  Summary:  There is a good chance of scattered strong to severe thunderstorms this evening and tonight across southern portions of Oklahoma and North Texas.  Storms will likely begin forming across the southern Texas Panhandle / northern rolling plains late this afternoon, and expand eastward into Oklahoma this evening.   Hail will be possible with storms that form initially over Texas and southwestern Oklahoma, with the primary risk transitioning to damaging wind as they push east.    Analysis: At 20Z, environmental conditions across the southern Great Plains favor the development of scattered strong to severe thunderstorms this evening and overnight.  Aloft, a shortwave trough over western Kansas is digging southward with positive vorticity advection commencing over northern Oklahoma and 500MB flow beginning to increase near the base of the trough.    At the surface, a lee surface low/trough was oriented from near Midland/Odessa northeastward into southern Oklahoma.  Along this trough axis, a diffuse surface boundary appears to extend from near KFDR northeast to near KOUN, with moisture pooling occurring in the southerly flow regime immediately to the south of this boundary.  Later this evening, as the boundary begins to press south into the moist and unstable environment already in place across southern Oklahoma and adjacent portions of Texas, convective initiation is likely to occur along and perhaps just behind the surface boundary.    To the south of the surface wind shift, a very moist low level airmass, characterized by dew points either side of 70F, is well-established.  Aloft, ~40kt 500mb westerlies are advecting steep mid-level lapse rates (7-8C/km)  overtop the moist boundary layer environment, yielding a thermodynamic and kinematic parameter space favorable for severe convection.  Though low level shear may increase a bit towards the evening hours, unfavorable LCLs >1,500ft should preclude any threat of tornadoes.    Based on CAM guidance, thunderstorms may begin developing as early as 21Z along the boundary.  A cluster of a few sub-severe storms was ongoing as of 20:26Z across Beckham and Washita counties, behind the wind-shift.  Even in this post-frontal environment, MLCAPE of 1500-2000j/kg could support storm maintenance and intensification, particularly given the proximity to the best upper-level support.  These storms may progress eastward towards southern sections of the OKC Metro area over the next few hours.  "
Unsettled Weather Wednesday and Thursday,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/07/22/unsettled-weather-wednesday-and-thursday/,"Wednesday, July 22 – 04Z   Summary: Unsettled weather is expected over the next several days, with episodes of strong storms likely to evolve from mid-day Wednesday through Thursday evening.  Severe storms are possible across western New England and the mid-Atlantic on Wednesday, with the region of greatest risk translating northeastward for Thursday afternoon and evening.    Analysis:  Zonal and seasonably weak flow is in place at this hour across the northern tier of the continental United States (CONUS), with 500mb wind magnitudes generally 40kts or less.  A shortwave trough translating eastward is centered over Minnesota as of 22.04Z is likely to clip New England tomorrow evening.   At the surface, a broad moist region typical of late July is established east of the front range of the Rockies with the richest boundary layer environment (dew points >72F) in place across the Mississippi River delta and along the eastern seaboard.  On the northern edge of the moisture, a warm front is becoming established from near Detroit, to near Binghamton, eastward to somewhere just south of Boston.  Across New York and New England, this warm front should make some northward progression overnight and during the first half of the day tomorrow.    By tomorrow afternoon, moderate mixed-layer instability will be present across the southern half of New York and portions of southwestern New England, despite marginal H7-H5 lapse rates.  Somewhat more robust (35-40kts) 500mb flow present at the base of the shortwave trough currently pivoting through the upper midwest should overspread this unstable air mass, resulting in effective bulk shear magnitudes supportive of storm intensification and organization.  Forecast soundings reveal an environment that could support storms with all hazards, perhaps even an isolated tornado, particularly from west-central Pennsylvania eastward into the Hudson Valley.    A few modes of convective evolution are possible tomorrow.  A cluster of storms currently draped from near Indianapolis southwestward into southern Illinois may translate northeastward and re-intensify towards peak heating tomorrow.  This appears to be the most probable trigger for convective development across PA, MD, WV, and VA.   Further north, additional thunderstorms may develop along the northwestern edge of the surface buoyancy axis, closer to the best upper-level support, across portions of upstate New York and central New England.  Any storms that develop within the broad warm sector could become strong or severe during the afternoon and evening hours. With time, the warm sector will continue to expand eastward in southern New England, and thunderstorms may continue to propagate toward the coast accordingly, gradually weakening by nightfall.    Overnight Wednesday, the warm sector will continue to expand into northern New England, and the boundary layer will further moisten in southern New England. Another shortwave disturbance is likely to ripple through the flow aloft, glancing the northern fringes of the warm sector Thursday afternoon as an attendant surface cold front begins to press south out of Canada.    South of the cold front, a moderately unstable environment will be in place with ML CAPE likely on the order of 1500-2000j/kg.  With 30-35kt of effective bulk shear transposed across the instability axis during peak heating, a richly moist boundary layer, and sufficient venting near the EL (right entrance region – RER – of a H250 jet streak) storm organization and intensification appears likely.    Though the overall evolution of the convection on Thursday is somewhat less clear, model soundings characterized by the aforementioned characteristics, straight hodographs, and 6-7C/KM H7-H5 lapse rates would imply that a corridor of elevated severe weather potential, with relatively intense storms capable of all hazards, may evolve during the late afternoon and evening somewhere in central/southern New England.  Stay tuned for details.  "
Isolated Severe Storms Possible This Afternoon,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/07/05/isolated-severe-storms-possible-this-afternoon/,"Sunday, July 5, 2020 – 12:30PM  Summary: There is a chance of isolated thunderstorms developing across New Hampshire, eastern Massachusetts, and southwestern Maine later today.  Though overall coverage in this area is expected to be low, any storm that forms may become severe and produce large hail, damaging winds, and perhaps a brief tornado.  Uncertainty is higher than usual for a day-of forecast, so be sure to stay alert for updates this afternoon and evening.    Analysis: A conditional, but perhaps very locally higher-end, severe threat could evolve across eastern New England later today.  A surface moist axis characterized by mid-upper 60s dew points extend from near KOKX to KLON, to KBOS, with drying occurring to the west of a surface boundary from near Newark, to Windsor Locks to just east of Jaffrey, to west and north of Concord, NH.  To the east of the boundary, low level stratus has largely cleared (except for along the immediate coast from Gloucester north into coastal Maine) allowing the boundary layer to warm into the 80s and destabilize.    Aloft, a shortwave rippling through the mid-level flow is approaching from the northwest.  In advance of the shortwave, forcing should be strongest across northern New England, where a few updrafts are already noted on radar across northern Maine, but some upper level support will likely extend southward and overlap with the more unstable environment across the coastal plain.  Strengthening mid-and-upper-level north-westerlies will result in shear magnitudes of 30-35kt across the moist sector, certainly supportive of organized convection.  Towards evening, there is some indication in the guidance that low-level shear will increase, with 0-3km SRH potentially >150m2/s2.  Relatively straight hodographs would favor a more multicellular storm mode, but any any mesoscale augmentation of the low-level shear profile (boundaries, right moving cells, etc.) may locally increase the potential for rotating updrafts.    With dry mid-levels and glancing forcing, storm coverage is expected to be quite low. In fact, some CAMs don’t develop storms at all outside of northern Maine.  I do expect at least one or two storms to form further south, and given the environment described previously, any cell that manages to sustain itself could become severe.  The most likely hazards appear to be large hail (perhaps 1-1.5″ in diameter), strong winds, and the outside chance of a brief tornado.  "
"A Few Storms North Today, Cooler for the Fourth",https://josephzampitella.com/2020/07/02/a-few-storms-north-today-cooler-for-the-fourth/,"Summary: Warm temperatures, with highs rising into the mid-80s region wide, are expected today, and a few strong storms may pop across the north country and drift south during the late afternoon.  During the day tomorrow, a backdoor cold front will usher in a fairly significant cool down, especially for coastal areas.  Temperatures will drop rapidly during the midday hours from the upper 70s region-wide, to the low 60s at the coast by evening (with slightly more mild readings inland).  A coastal-inland temperature gradient should persist into the Fourth of July holiday, with temperatures around 70F in the east and around 80F in the west.    Analysis: First and foremost, today’s convective chances.  As the upper level low that has dominated weather the last several days pulls away, a shortwave trough rippling through the flow aloft will kick off one or more bands of thunderstorms across southern Canada and northern New England this afternoon.  A warm, moist environment at the surface, with middle 60s dew points extending north to the Canadian border, combined with ample diurnal heating should drive the development of some surface based instability across a broad region from the upper Hudson Valley east into Maine.    Northerly deep layer flow of 20-35kts juxtaposed over westerly to southwesterly surface winds will result in effective bulk shear magnitudes of 25-35kts region wide.  With this degree of shear, a severe storm or two can not be entirely ruled out.  CAM guidance indicates some risk of storms may extend into southern New England during the evening hours, but coverage is expected to be low.    As the boundary layer cools and the upper level disturbance begins to pull away late this evening, storms should dissipate by 03Z at the latest.  In response to the shortwave, a surface low will organize in the Gulf of Maine overnight Thursday into Friday morning.  In response to the surface pressure falls, boundary layer winds across much of New England become easterly and eventually northeasterly Friday morning.  These winds will mark the arrival of a strong backdoor cold front, which should arrive in Boston, Lawrence and Concord around 13Z, in Worcester around 14:30Z, in the Pioneer Valley around 16Z, and in the Berkshires around 20Z.  As the front moves through, temperatures in the upper 70s and low 80s should cool into the 60s in most places, though it may remain a bit warmer in the more protected valleys.    Northerly-to-northeasterly flow will likely maintain itself at the surface through the Independence Day holiday.  With the strong July sun angle, the temperatures in the cool sector should moderate at least somewhat on Saturday, but with the breeze off the North Atlantic, daytime highs will probably struggle to exceed 72-74F at the immediate coast, and 80F inland, well below average for midsummer.

Strong Storms Probable Today (6-28),https://josephzampitella.com/2020/06/28/strong-storms-probable-today-6-28/,"Summary: Strong to severe storms appear probable tomorrow afternoon and evening across much of New England.  Though severe weather will likely be isolated, the most intense storms may produce hail up to 1.5″ in diameter and wind gusts, along with heavy downpours and lightning.  The best chance of seeing a storm will be between 2PM and 6PM across Massachusetts, Connecticut, southern New Hampshire, and northern Rhode Island.    Analysis: As of 04Z Sunday, mesoanlysis reveals a subtle shortwave currently located near KAPX (Alpena, MI), oscillating southeastward around a closed 500mb low centered over southeastern Canada.  Given the modest belt of H5 west-north-westerlies south of the low, this feature should approach New England around 18-21Z today, setting the stage for one or more rounds of thunderstorm development.    At the surface, a relatively rich pool of moisture is present over and especially just off the mid-Atlantic coast, an airmass that should translate northward into the morning hours.  The 28.00Z OKX profile revealed an impressively moist low level environment, with small dew point depressions from the surface to 600mb and a corresponding PW value of 1.77″.  Additionally, surface dew points of 66-68F, moister than the 00Z high resolution guidance mean, are being observed as far north as KPYM and KBDL, indicating, in conjunction with the RAOB from OKX, that the low-level environment will likely be at least as moist as indicated by the guidance.    In conjunction with ample insolation and sufficient mid-level lapse rates, the moist boundary layer should yield a widespread moderately unstable environment characterized by MLCAPE on the order of 1500-2000j/kg.  Though sampled lapse rates at 00Z were not impressive, there may be some improvement tomorrow as 500mb temperatures cool by 2-3C.  All told, I am confident the environment will destabilize enough to support robust updrafts during the afternoon and evening.    As mentioned earlier in the discussion, winds aloft will not be particularly strong, and deep layer shear will be meager accordingly, likely only on the order of 25-30kts in the effective layer.  With that said, the wind profile is unidirectional and fairly well-organized above 2km, so some storm organization, especially into loose clusters or transient bowing segments, is not out of the question.    With sufficient shear for loose storm organization and large buoyancy (by New England standards), hail up to 1.5″ in diameter should be a threat with the most intense updrafts, an idea supported by numerous severe hail analogs on model soundings across the region.  Strong to locally damaging winds should also be realized given DCAPE >=700j/kg as inverted-V profiles develop towards peak heating.    Taking a peek at the latest HREF – convection-allowing guidance indicates the greatest concentration of robust updrafts should materialize along an arc from east-central New Hampshire southward across Massachusetts and Connecticut during the late afternoon hours.  Given the expectation of weaker deep layer flow and buoyancy across northern New England, I think storms may be a bit weaker in this area despite slightly cooler temperatures aloft.    The most probably scenario appears to be the evolution of one or more bands of storms, with strong to severe cells embedded across central and particularly Southern New England, perhaps extending westward into portions of the lower Hudson Valley.   The chance of storms should maximize between 18-22Z, perhaps lingering a bit longer in the easternmost counties.  "
Toasts for Two,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/06/27/toasts-for-two/,"Ingredients – The Avocado Toast  Assembly – The Herbal Avocado Toast  Begin by lightly toasting the Francese – 5 to 10 minutes at 250F in the oven should do the trick (you’ll use this for both the avocado and tomato dishes – so be sure to toast plenty!).  While the bread is toasting, combine the two avocados, juice and zest of one lime, extra virgin olive oil, and spices in a bowl.  Mash with a fork until only small chunks of of avocado remain and all of the additional ingredients are well combined.  Once the toast is completed, smear it with the avocado spread, adjusting the amount to your taste.  A sprinkle of red pepper flakes and sea salt make for a delicious final touch.  Ingredients – Cherry Tomato Toast  Assembly – The Cherry Tomato Toast  This dish is all assembly – and even that is super simple!  While your bread is toasting, slice 2 cups of small, ripe cherry tomatoes into quarters.  If you prefer, feel free to dice them instead, but I’ve found quartering them makes for a heartier bite and more visually interesting presentation.  Once the toasting is complete, arrange the sliced tomatoes evenly on top and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil.  Next sprinkle the basil, salt, and cracked black pepper and give them a spritz of lemon juice.   Pulling it All Together  Plate your avocado toast together with your cherry tomato toast.  I think they look best on a plain white serving dish, but feel free to personalize the presentation as you see fit.  Add a garnish of fresh thyme and/or basil, and you’re ready to serve!"
Chance of Thunderstorms Later Today,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/06/24/chance-of-thunderstorms-later-today/,"Summary: A few thunderstorms are possible this afternoon, primarily north of the Massachusetts Turnpike in southern New England, and across New Hampshire and western Maine in northern New England.  A few stronger storms may produce torrential rainfall, frequent lightning, and gusty winds.  Storms should be most numerous between 2PM and 6PM.   Analysis: A warm and humid airmass, characterized by dew points a couple degrees either side of 70F, is in place across southern New England.  Further to the north, dew points drop off somewhat, but remain climatologically high across much of western Maine and New Hampshire, with readings generally 64-67F.  A surface low south of the Hudson Bay is pulling northeast and will drag a cold front east across New England later today, increasing the chance for a few hit-or-miss thunderstorms to develop.   500mb heights will remain neutral or fall slightly (with greater height falls west of the cold front) as a closed low near Hudson Bay translates east. Deep layer shear will marginally increase through the day as 30-40kt H5 flow overspreads the moist low level environment east of the cold front.  The co-location of shear and moisture may thread the needle and support a few more robust updrafts later today, particularly across southern New Hampshire and far northeast Massachusetts.  Though mid-level lapse rates are weak (less than 6C/KM) as modeled and sampled by 6/24 12Z balloon soundings around the region, the richly moist boundary layer environment should allow skinny ML CAPE profiles of 1000-1500j/kg to develop ahead of the cold front.  It is worth nothing that cloud cover is extensive across the warm sector at this time and surface insolation/attendant instability may be limited accordingly.    Based on the factors outlined above, the mean of solutions expressed by the convection allowing models appears reasonable.  Thunderstorms will develop ahead of the advancing cold front by 2PM and push east.  It seems probable that the highest concentration of storms will be across southern portions of New Hampshire, far southwest Maine and northeastern Massachusetts.  In this region, a strong to severe storm or two is not out of the question.  "
Heat Builds in New England Late This Week,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/06/16/heat-builds-in-new-england-late-this-week/,"Summary: Heat and humidity will build late this week across New England, with the core of the most uncomfortable air likely focused across portions of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.  Within this region, a combination of daytime temperatures in the upper 80s to low 90s and dewpoints likely exceeding 65F will characterize New England’s first multi-day hot spell of 2020.   Confidence is high in very warm temperatures Thursday, Friday and Saturday within the aforementioned areas.  Warm temperatures may persist into early next week, but the details and degree of any heat remain unclear at this point.      Analysis: As of Tuesday evening, an interesting pattern for mid-June is in place across the eastern half of the CONUS.  A cutoff low centered over South Carolina is dominating weather in the southeastern United States, with a significant ridge axis to the north and west of this low extending from the southern Great Plains into the upper Midwest and southern Canada.    Over the course of the next 48 hours, the portion of the upper level ridge currently centered over the Great Lakes/upper Midwest is expected to build into northern New England and adjacent portions of the Canadian Maritimes, setting the stage for increasingly summer-like weather.  At 850mb, a warm conveyor is expected to develop underneath the 500mb ridge, transporting relatively hot (+18 to +21C) air from the southern Rockies/High Plains into northern New England by Thursday morning.  The 850mb temperatures will likely modify by the time they reach the northeast, with values of +16 to +18C most common. The core of the hotter air will actually be focused over Nova Scotia, where a +20C 850mb reading is not out of the question.   In conjunction with the warm air advection aloft, the boundary layer will also gradually moisten across the Northeast through the weekend as surface flow develops a more southerly component.  The peak of the hot and humid conditions at this time appears to be on Saturday,  though humid (but perhaps somewhat less hot) weather could linger into early next week.  "
A Superior Breakfast,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/06/04/my-test-recipe/,"Option 1: Reinforced Oatmeal, Banana, RxBar, Kombucha  Ingredients  Instructions  Begin by mixing the Whole Oats with slightly over 3/4 cups of water,  microwave for 1 minute & 15 seconds and combine until even.  At this point, the oatmeal may be a bit more liquid than it will ultimately be, it should consolidate as it cools.    Next, add in the Flax, Chia Seeds, Honey and Creatine and mix until well combined.  If you prefer your oatmeal on its own, let it cool for a few minutes and you’re good to go after this step!  If the mood strikes you, adding a few toppings can make your breakfast can make it feel a bit more decadent. Raspberries, diced Strawberries, or a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg all will give the oatmeal a pop of freshness.    Option 2: Blended Berry & Dragonfruit Bowl  Ingredients  Instructions  Packed with nutrients and very quick to make, this is an ideal recipe for a breakfast or brunch.    Begin by adding the frozen berries, frozen mango, dragonfruit puree and water into a blender.  Feel free to adjust the exact ratios of the different ingredients to achieve your favorite consistency.  In my experience, the ideal consistency is somewhere between a liquid and a paste, where the fruit puree is easy to pour into a bowl, but also enjoyable to eat with a spoon.    Once well-blended, pour the fruit puree into a serving bowl.  Next, add the toppings to taste.  My favorite combination of toppings includes generous helpings of granola, chia seeds, taco nibs, and fresh berries, with a light dusting of cinnamon on top.  For an extra pop of color and citrus, add a lemon twist just before serving.  "
New England Storm Chances (6/6/2020) – Analysis,https://josephzampitella.com/2020/06/04/example-post-3/,"Updated 6/5/2020 – 21Z  Strong to severe storms appear possible across primarily eastern New England tomorrow afternoon.   Summary: A few strong to severe storms should impact eastern portions of New England tomorrow afternoon.  Marginally severe hail, strong winds, and heavy downpours are expected to be the primary hazards in any storms that develop.    Analysis: A favorable co-location of severe weather ingredients should occur for a several-hour window over portions of mainly eastern New England tomorrow afternoon, likely providing just enough support for strong to isolated severe thunderstorms.    An upper-level trough emerging from the Great Lakes will translate east across the northeast United States during the day on Friday.  Falling 500mb heights through the day increases confidence in convective initiation, and should aid in storm maintenance within a favorable prefrontal boundary layer environment.  Attendant to this upper level impulse, moderately strong mid-to-upper level flow, perhaps as strong as 50KT at 500mb, should overspread much of New England by 18Z.  This magnitude of deep layer flow will result in regionally impressive 0-6KM shear values, likely on the order of 40-50kts, supportive of organized convective modes.  At the surface,  a warm and moist boundary layer airmass, characterized by surface dew points in the 66-69F range, should be in place ahead of a cold front plunging southeast out of southern Canada.  The timing of this front remains the central question for the convective evolution on Friday afternoon and will determine the overall degree of the severe weather risk.  Based on a blend of the latest high resolution guidance, centrally focused on the 05/12Z SPC SSEO, it appears that the frontal passage should occur late enough in the day that storms will materialize and intensify ahead of the boundary.  It is also worth noting that guidance has trended somewhat slower with this front over the past 48 hours.  Additionally, ensemble guidance supports the idea that the front may not clear the coastline in southern New England until 00Z, an ideal window for storm development.  Confidence is increasing that storms will occur.    Though the pre-frontal environment will be warm and richly moist in the boundary layer, weak mid-level lapse rates will limit the degree to which the atmosphere destabilizes.  MLCAPE should peak around 1500j/kg between 2PM and 6PM ahead of the front in southern New England.  Model soundings indicate some dry air off the deck, particularly in the 700mb – 250mb layer, which may inhibit updrafts somewhat despite an otherwise uncapped and buoyant environment.    All factors together, the forecast above tightly reflected the ultimate convective evolution.  Storms developed as expected along the surging cold front and intensified as they approached the coast.  Most damaging wind reports were concentrated within the area delineated as higher-risk across central and eastern Massachusetts, northeast Connecticut, southeast New Hampshire, and southern Maine.
